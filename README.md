# Sports Ball Trajectory Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates the trajectory of a football kick, taking into account variables such as initial velocity, launch angle, and wind resistance. It calculates the maximum height, range, and flight path of the ball based on the principles of motion physics and simulates a real-world kick scenario.

## Features

- **Input:** Users can enter the initial velocity, angle of the kick, and wind resistance factor.
- **Physics-based Simulation:** The project calculates the ball's trajectory using gravitational force and air drag (wind resistance).
- **Visualization (Python only):** The Python version of the project uses **Matplotlib** to graphically display the football's flight path.
- **Platform Support:** Both Python and Java versions are provided.

## Requirements

### Python
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python installed.
- **Libraries**: Youâ€™ll need the `matplotlib` library for plotting the trajectory in Python.
    - Install using `pip`:
      ```bash
      pip install matplotlib
      ```

### Java
- **Java 8+**: Ensure you have a recent version of Java installed (Java 8 or later).

## Usage

### Python
1. Clone the repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sports-ball-trajectory.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and run the Python script.
    ```bash
    python sports_project.py
    ```

3. Enter the **initial velocity**, **angle of the kick**, and **wind resistance factor** when prompted. A graph showing the trajectory will be displayed.

### Java
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the Java version.
2. Compile and run the Java file.
    ```bash
    javac SportsProject.java
    java SportsProject
    ```

3. Enter the initial velocity, angle of the kick, and wind resistance factor when prompted. The max height and range will be printed.

## Key Components

- **Python Libraries:** Matplotlib (for plotting).
- **Java:** Basic Java Standard Library (no external dependencies).
- **Physics Calculation:** Incorporates gravitational force and wind resistance for realistic ball motion.

## Example Output

### Python:

```bash
Max Height: 5.12 meters
Range: 20.45 meters
Java:
bash
Copy code
Max Height: 5.12 meters
Range: 20.45 meters
Further Improvements
Multiple Ball Simulation: Simulate multiple kicks with varying parameters.
Wind Gusts: Introduce dynamic wind patterns for a more realistic environment.
3D Simulation: Enhance the project to simulate 3D trajectories (especially useful for football and tennis).
Machine Learning: Predict the kick outcomes based on player performance data.


### **How to Use This in Your Portfolio/GitHub**:

1. **Create a repository on GitHub** named something like `sports-ball-trajectory-simulation`.
2. **Add both Python and Java directories** under your repository with their respective code files.
3. **Upload the README.md** as the repository's main file so that potential employers can easily understand the project and how it relates to your skills in sports technology.

This project showcases both your coding skills and understanding of physics in sports, which should
